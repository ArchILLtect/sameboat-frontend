## Overview (Week 2 - Sept 22 - 28)

**Spilled over into 30th**

### Milestones:

-   Established clear AI/agent guidance via copilot-instructions.md.
-   Enhanced developer onboarding: expanded README.md, added CONTRIBUTING.md, and created architecture.md.
-   Introduced runtime safety: added health.ts with a type guard and refactored Home to use it.
-   Enforced quality: fixed lint/type issues and validated build pipeline alignment with Node 20.
-   Added production backend integration: switched API base from localhost to https://api-sameboat.onrender.com with configurable VITE_API_BASE_URL.
-   Documented repository migration (old org → sameboat-platform/frontend) across key docs.
-   Improved internal API abstraction (api.ts base URL logic, buildUrl helper).

### What Went Well:

Fast iteration with minimal churn—each change built on prior structure (types, guards, docs).
Clear separation of responsibilities: API helper, runtime guard, docs, and CI alignment.
Documentation now forms a coherent stack: high-level (README), process (CONTRIBUTING), architecture (architecture.md), and agent instructions.
Migration handled cleanly without broken references; forward-looking patterns (guards, env override) added early.

### What We Struggled With

Initial lack of tests delayed adding confidence around runtime behavior (still no test harness).

Needed a manual cleanup pass for duplicated sections in the first agent instructions draft.
Architectural depth is still thin (no routing, state management, or error boundary patterns), making future extension decisions pending.
Environment awareness (dev vs prod indicators, error surfacing) not yet surfaced in the UI.
If you want, next steps could include: add Vitest + a first test, introduce routing, centralize error handling, and surface API health status in the UI. Let me know if you want that queued.
