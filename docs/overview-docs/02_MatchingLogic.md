# Matching Logic

## Goals
- Maximize trust, safety, and longitudinal engagement.
- Balance user-stated preferences with measured compatibility.

## Inputs
- Baseline filters: language, timezone, availability, boundaries.
- Preferences: listener/encourager, similar/different experience, personality vibe.
- Compatibility signals: goal alignment, communication style, values alignment.
- Icebreakers: interest tags (Peer tier).

## Scoring (Draft)
- S = 0.35 * Compatibility + 0.25 * Preferences + 0.20 * Availability overlap + 0.20 * Safety/Boundaries fit
- Apply caps for dealbreakers (e.g., boundary mismatches).

## Feedback Loop
- After 1–3 interactions, prompt gentle rating (“felt heard?”, “felt safe?”, “want to continue?”).
- Use outcomes to adjust weights and improve future matches.

## Edge Cases
- Avoid echo chambers: introduce safe, minor contrast.
- Prevent romantic drift in Mentor tier with guidelines and monitoring.
