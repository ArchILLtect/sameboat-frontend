# SameBoat Project Overview

_Last updated: 2025-08-19_

## 🌊 Vision & Mission
**Vision:** No one should have to navigate struggle alone. SameBoat connects people with the right kind of support — from peers to mentors to professionals — helping them grow, heal, and thrive.
**Mission:** Build a growth platform where sharing stories, finding support, and gaining confidence all happen in one safe, inclusive space.

## 🚤 Core Concept
SameBoat centers on the idea that **we are all in the same waters, but at different stages of the journey**.
- **Sharers** — signal their story.
- **Peers/Friends** — company on the boat.
- **Mentors** — row alongside and guide.
- **Professionals** — trained helpers with anchors.

## 🧩 Matching Logic (Summary)
- **Baseline filters:** language, availability, boundaries.
- **Preferences:** listener vs encourager; similar experience vs fresh perspective; personality vibe.
- **Compatibility:** goal alignment; communication style; values.
- **Feedback loop:** failed matches become better-data, not failures.

## 🛠️ Core Features (Planned)
- Story sharing (Sharer)
- 1:1 chat (Peer/Mentor)
